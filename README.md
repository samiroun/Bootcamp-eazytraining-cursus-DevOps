# ⚡️ Welcome to my proof of work during my 3 months bootcamp from Eazy-Training ⚡️
---
###### This repository is made to track my progress in the eazy-training "cursus-devops" bootcamp. It will include all the work I will do in the next 3 months (September 2022 to end of November 2022) and beyond.

## 📰 Short introduction 📰
I am in a career transition. During the last 10 years, I have evolved in the field of networks and telecoms. I live in Lille, France 🇫🇷

In July 2022, I asked myself "what do you want to learn every day?".

And the answer was... Devops & Cloud! From that moment on, I studied on my own and then I had the chance to join this hands-on oriented bootcamp.

And now, even if I still have a lot to learn,
thanks to this bootcamp I am ready to build, deploy and automate your infrastructure in the cloud.

## _Bootcamp program :_
__First month__ : Micro-services with Docker 🐋 and Kubernetes

__Second Month__ : Pipeline CI/CD with Jenkins / Gitlab CI

__Third Month__ : Automatisation and IaC (Infrastructure as Code) with Ansible ⚙️ and Terraform

## 📰 Mes futures certifications 📰
Even if this very large world of DevOps is very rich in techno, here are the particular topics I am interested in and on which I think I will prepare certifications : 

- AWS Cloud 
- Terraform
- Kubernetes

## 🔎 What you'll find here and the purpose of it 🔎
On this repo, all of my exercices and training during the formations will be uploaded. It'll be a way for myself and for other IT colleages, recruiter, companies... to monitor my progression during these few months. It'll also be a good way to build a portfolio, with proof of concept / work of my job and my knowledge.
